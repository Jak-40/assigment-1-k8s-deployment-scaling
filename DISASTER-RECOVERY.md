# Disaster Recovery Strategy for Nginx Demo Application

This document outlines comprehensive disaster recovery strategies for the nginx demo application deployed on AWS EKS, covering both multi-AZ high availability and multi-region disaster recovery scenarios.

## üèó Multi-AZ High Availability Setup

### Current Implementation Benefits

The existing deployment already incorporates several multi-AZ capabilities that leverage EKS's built-in multi-AZ support:

**Pod Anti-Affinity Configuration**: The deployment manifest includes pod anti-affinity rules that encourage pod distribution across different nodes and availability zones. This ensures that if one AZ experiences issues, application instances remain available in other zones.

**AWS Load Balancer Controller Integration**: The ALB automatically distributes traffic across healthy targets in multiple AZs. The health check configuration ensures that only healthy pods receive traffic, providing automatic failover at the load balancer level.

**Persistent Volume Considerations**: While the current nginx deployment is stateless, the configuration includes guidelines for EBS volume handling. For stateful applications, EBS volumes are AZ-specific, requiring careful planning for cross-AZ data access patterns.

### Enhanced Multi-AZ Configuration

To further strengthen multi-AZ resilience, consider these additional configurations:

**Node Group Distribution**: Ensure your EKS node groups span multiple AZs and use diverse instance types to reduce single points of failure. Configure node affinity rules to guarantee workload distribution across zones.

**Zone-Aware Autoscaling**: Implement cluster autoscaler with zone-balancing enabled to maintain proportional capacity across AZs. This prevents concentration of resources in a single zone during scaling events.

**Cross-AZ Monitoring**: Deploy monitoring agents that track the health and performance of resources across all AZs. Set up alerts for zone-specific degradation or imbalanced resource distribution.

## üåê Multi-Region Disaster Recovery

### Architecture Overview

A robust multi-region DR strategy involves deploying identical application stacks in geographically separated AWS regions, with automated failover mechanisms and data synchronization protocols.

### Primary Components

**Route 53 Health Checks and Failover**: Configure Route 53 with health checks pointing to ALB endpoints in each region. Implement DNS-based failover with automatic switchover when the primary region becomes unhealthy. Use latency-based routing during normal operations to direct users to the closest healthy region.

**Cross-Region Data Replication**: For stateful components, implement asynchronous replication using AWS services. Database replication can leverage RDS cross-region read replicas with promotion capabilities. Object storage benefits from S3 cross-region replication with versioning enabled for point-in-time recovery.

**Infrastructure as Code Consistency**: Maintain identical infrastructure definitions using Terraform or CloudFormation across regions. Version control all infrastructure code and implement automated deployment pipelines that can provision entire environments consistently. This ensures rapid recovery and eliminates configuration drift between regions.

### Implementation Strategy

**Active-Passive Setup**: Deploy the primary application stack in the main region with a standby environment in the DR region. The standby environment runs minimal resources to reduce costs while maintaining the ability to scale rapidly during failover events.

**Automated Backup and Restore**: Implement automated backup procedures for all persistent data, configuration, and secrets. Store backups in multiple regions using encrypted S3 buckets with lifecycle policies. Test restore procedures regularly to validate recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO).

**Cross-Region Network Connectivity**: Establish VPC peering or Transit Gateway connections between regions for secure communication during replication and failover processes. Configure appropriate security groups and NACLs to allow necessary traffic while maintaining security boundaries.

### Monitoring and Alerting

**Regional Health Monitoring**: Deploy comprehensive monitoring that tracks application performance, infrastructure health, and business metrics across all regions. Implement escalation procedures that trigger DR activation based on predefined criteria such as sustained high error rates, complete service unavailability, or infrastructure failures.

**Automated Failover Triggers**: Configure automated systems that can initiate failover procedures based on health check failures, application metrics, or infrastructure alerts. Include human approval steps for significant operational changes while allowing automatic failover for critical scenarios.

**Communication Protocols**: Establish clear communication channels and escalation procedures for DR events. Maintain updated contact lists, runbooks, and decision trees that guide response teams through various failure scenarios.

This multi-layered approach ensures business continuity through automated high availability within regions and comprehensive disaster recovery capabilities across regions, providing resilience against both localized failures and major regional outages.
